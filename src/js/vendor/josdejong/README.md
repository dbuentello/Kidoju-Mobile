Besides:
- https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs
- https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs-expression-parser (limited version of the mathjs expression parser but missing functions like random and round).

We have considered:
- https://github.com/silentmatt/expr-eval
- https://github.com/redhivesoftware/math-expression-evaluator
- https://github.com/kisonecat/math-expressions

Note: we really need to optimize the mathjs bundle as explained at https://mathjs.org/docs/custom_bundling.html
